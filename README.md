- 👋 Hi! I’m **@BornaGajic**, a graduate student at the Department of Mathematics, Osijek - **Math** & **Computer science** program
- :computer: I love to work on everything from the low-level (_'to the metal'_) C/C++ stuff to a web/desktop app development
- 🤖 So far, I've coded in these languages (sorted by preference): 
  - **C#** (web, desktop, socket, COM) <sub><sup>/Bits-and-pieces, /Devbazaar, /Chat-o-Tron, /doc-fill-tool</sup></sub>
  - **C++** (alghoritms, data structures) <sub><sup>/Bits-and-pieces</sup></sub>
  - **JavaScript** (Angular, AngularJS, React) <sub><sup>/Bits-and-pieces, /Devbazaar</sup></sub>
  - **Python** (Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, SciPy, NumPy) <sub><sup>/Bits-and-pieces, /FAQ-Mathos-Chatbot</sup></sub>
- :books: Besides that I'm learning about **Machine learning** - both the mathematical and practical side of it
- :earth_africa: I enjoy **traveling**, reading **manga**, having a nice **craft beer**, and other usual non-geeky activities :grin:
- 📝 Also, I've have some stories on **Medium**! [Check it out](https://medium.com/@bornagajic)
- 🔨 Currently working at [Mono Software](https://mono.software/)
