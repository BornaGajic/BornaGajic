- ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m **@BornaGajic**, an undergraduate student at the Department of mathematics, Osijek - **Computer science** program.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming! By that I mean: from a low level (_'to the metal'_) C/C++ stuff, to a web/desktop app development.
- :books: Currently, I'm also learning about Machine learning - both the mathematical and practical side of it.
