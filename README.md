- ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m **@BornaGajic**, an undergraduate student at the Department of mathematics, Osijek - **Computer science** program.
- :computer: Iâ€™m interested in **programming**! By that I mean: from the low level (_'to the metal'_) C/C++ stuff, to a web/desktop app development.
- :earth_africa: Besides programming, I enjoy **traveling**, reading **manga**, having a nice **craft beer**, and other usual non-geeky activities :grin:
- :books: Currently, I'm also learning about **Machine learning** - both the mathematical and practical side of it.
