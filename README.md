- 👋 Hi! I’m **@BornaGajic**, an undergraduate student at the Department of mathematics, Osijek - **Computer science** program.
- :computer: I’m interested in **programming**! From the low-level (_'to the metal'_) C/C++ stuff to a web/desktop app development.
- :books: Besides that I'm learning about **Machine learning** - both the mathematical and practical side of it.
- :earth_africa: I enjoy **traveling**, reading **manga**, having a nice **craft beer**, and other usual non-geeky activities :grin:
- 📝 Also, I've recently wrote my first **Medium** story! [Check it out](https://bornagajic.medium.com/persist-your-complex-map-object-with-mobx-persist-store-8530deb017aa)
